package Recursion;

/*
You are given a string s. You need to print the lexicographically sorted power-set of the string.
Note: The string s contains lowercase letter of alphabet.

Input:
The first line of input contains T, denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcases contains one line of input containing string s.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the lexicographically sorted sub-sets of the powerset of s. Each subset is separated by a space. Each subset starts with empty string represented by " "(space).

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function powerSet that takes string s as parameter and returns a vector/ArrayList of subsets. The lexicographic-sorting and printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= |s| <= 10

Examples:
Input:
2
a
abc
Output:
 a
 a ab abc ac b bc c

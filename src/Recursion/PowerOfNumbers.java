/*
Given a number N, let the reverse of the number be R. The task is to print the output of the Expression power(N,R), where pow function represents N raised to power R.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 109 + 7.

Input:
The first line of the input consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing an integer N.

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, print in a new line, the output of the expression pow as described above.

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You just need to complete the function pow that takes two parameters N and R and returns power of (N to R)mod(109 + 7)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 105

Example:
Input:
2

12
Output:

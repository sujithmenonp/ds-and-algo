Concepts/Ideas
To find the number of digits of a number
1. Recursive solution
2. iterative solution
3. floor(logn+1)

Arithmetic progression
nth term = a+ (n-1)*d
sum of n terms = n/2[2a+(n-1)*d]

Geometric progression
nth term = ar^n
sum of n terms = a(1-r^n)/(1-r)

For a quadratic equation (ax^2+bx+c=0)
1. 2 roots
2. b^-4ac is the discriminate(D)
3. if D>0 - 2 distinct real roots
4. if D<0 - 2 distinct imaginary roots
5. if D==0 - 2 equal roots
6. Roots are (-b +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a

Mean And Median

Prime number
Any prime number can be represented as 6n+1 or 6n-1 except 2 and 3
2 and 3 are the only consecutive numbers that are prime

GCD/HCF and LCM
LCM * HCF = product

Factorials
0! = 1

Permutation
nPr = n!/(n-r)!
nCr = n!/r!(n-r)

Number of digits in a factorial?
floor(log(n!)+1)

Primalty test
Check if a number is prime by checking if all numbers less than sqrt(n) is not divisble by that number
n%2!=0 and n%3!=0 and n%(6n+-1) should not be zero

A prime square has exactly 3 divisors

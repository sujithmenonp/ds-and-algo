Given an unsigned integer N. The task is to swap all odd bits with even bits.
 For example, if the given number is 23 (00010111), it should be converted to 43(00101011).
 Here, every even position bit is swapped with adjacent bit on right side(even position bits are highlighted
  in binary representation of 23), and every odd position bit is swapped with adjacent on left side.
